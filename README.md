# Codenames Duet

Did you ever wish you could play codenames duet with someone without an internet connection?
This application lets you do exactly that.

_Disclaimer: you DO still need a way to communicate with your partner that doesn't rely on an internet connection. We suggest being on the phone with the other player during the game._

# How it works
First, decide if you are player 1 or player 2.

If you're player 1, you will be given a random seed. This determines the words of the game.

If you're player 2, you will need to input player 1's seed. This ensures that you both have the same word setup.
